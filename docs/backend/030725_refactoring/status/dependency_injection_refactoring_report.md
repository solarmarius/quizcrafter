## 1. Implemented Changes by Category

### 1.1 Service Layer Enhancements

**Changes Implemented**:

- ✅ Created centralized `ServiceContainer` class for dependency management
- ✅ Eliminated global service singleton (`mcq_generation_service`)
- ✅ Implemented proper service lifecycle management with `@lru_cache`
- ✅ Added type-safe dependency aliases for FastAPI integration

**Details**:

```python
# Before: app/services/mcq_generation.py
# Global singleton instantiation - hard to test and mock
mcq_generation_service = MCQGenerationService()

# After: app/core/dependencies.py
class ServiceContainer:
    """Service container for managing service dependencies and lifecycle."""

    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache
    def get_mcq_generation_service() -> MCQGenerationService:
        """Get MCQ generation service instance."""
        return MCQGenerationService()

    @staticmethod
    def get_content_extraction_service(
        canvas_token: str, course_id: int
    ) -> ContentExtractionService:
        """Get content extraction service with configuration."""
        return ContentExtractionService(canvas_token=canvas_token, course_id=course_id)

# FastAPI dependency aliases
MCQServiceDep = Annotated[
    MCQGenerationService, Depends(ServiceContainer.get_mcq_generation_service)
]
```

**Impact**:
- Services are now properly testable with dependency injection
- Consistent service creation patterns across the application
- Better separation of concerns between service creation and usage
- Foundation for future service enhancements and decorators

### 1.2 API Routes Refactoring

**Changes Implemented**:

- ✅ Updated all service instantiation to use `ServiceContainer`
- ✅ Removed direct service class imports from route handlers
- ✅ Implemented proper service injection in background tasks

**Details**:

```python
# Before: app/api/routes/quiz.py
from app.services.mcq_generation import mcq_generation_service
from app.services.content_extraction import ContentExtractionService

# Direct instantiation in background tasks
extraction_service = ContentExtractionService(canvas_token, course_id)
result = await mcq_generation_service.generate_mcqs_for_quiz(...)

# After: app/api/routes/quiz.py
from app.core.dependencies import ServiceContainer

# Consistent service container usage
extraction_service = ServiceContainer.get_content_extraction_service(canvas_token, course_id)
mcq_service = ServiceContainer.get_mcq_generation_service()
result = await mcq_service.generate_mcqs_for_quiz(...)
```

**Impact**:
- Eliminated direct coupling between routes and service implementations
- Consistent service access patterns throughout the codebase
- Better testability of route handlers and background tasks

### 1.3 Testing Infrastructure Improvements

**Changes Implemented**:

- ✅ Updated all service tests to work with dependency injection
- ✅ Implemented proper service mocking using `ServiceContainer` patches
- ✅ Removed tests for deprecated global service instances

**Details**:

```python
# Before: Tests patched service classes directly
with patch("app.api.routes.quiz.ContentExtractionService") as mock_service_class:
    mock_service_class.return_value = mock_service

# After: Tests patch service container methods
with patch("app.api.routes.quiz.ServiceContainer.get_content_extraction_service") as mock_factory:
    mock_factory.return_value = mock_service
```

**Impact**:
- All 95 service tests pass with new dependency injection system
- Improved test reliability and isolation
- Better mocking capabilities for integration tests

## 2. Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

**No Breaking Changes**: The refactoring was implemented with zero breaking changes for API consumers. All public APIs maintain the same contracts and behavior.

**Internal Changes Only**:
- Service instantiation patterns changed internally
- Test mocking approaches updated
- Import statements modified in route handlers

## 3. Technical Debt Analysis

**Debt Reduced**:
- ✅ Eliminated 1 major code smell: Global singleton pattern
- ✅ Resolved service testing difficulties
- ✅ Removed tight coupling between components
- ✅ Improved service lifecycle management

**Remaining Debt**:
- None identified in the service layer post-refactoring
- Service layer now follows clean architecture principles

## 4. Testing & Validation

#### Test Results:
- **Service Tests**: 95/95 passed ✅
- **Unit Tests**: All MCQ generation tests passing ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Background task tests updated and passing ✅

#### Validation Checklist:
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ API contracts maintained
- ✅ No database migrations required
- ✅ LangGraph workflows functioning correctly
- ✅ Service mocking working in all test scenarios

## 5. Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge Faced | Solution Implemented | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Background tasks can't use FastAPI dependency injection | Used ServiceContainer pattern for background task service instantiation | Clean service access without FastAPI DI limitations |
| Test mocking complexity with new DI system | Updated test patches to target ServiceContainer methods | All tests passing with improved mocking reliability |
| Maintaining singleton behavior for stateless services | Used `@lru_cache` decorator on service factory methods | Efficient singleton pattern with dependency injection benefits |

## 6. Documentation Updates

**Updated Documentation**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive docstrings to ServiceContainer class
- ✅ Documented service dependency patterns
- ✅ Updated service method signatures and return types

**New Documentation Created**:
- ✅ Service dependency injection guide (this report)
- ✅ Testing patterns for mocking services

## 7. Architecture Design Decisions

**ServiceContainer Pattern Choice**:
- **Rationale**: FastAPI background tasks cannot use standard DI, so ServiceContainer provides consistent service access
- **Benefits**:
  - Testable service creation
  - Centralized service configuration
  - Type-safe service dependencies
  - Compatible with both route handlers and background tasks

**Factory Function Approach**:
- Services requiring runtime parameters (canvas_token, course_id) use factory functions
- Stateless services use cached singleton pattern with `@lru_cache`

## 8. Future Recommendations

**Immediate Actions** (Current Sprint):
1. ✅ **Completed**: All dependency injection refactoring tasks finished

**Medium-term Improvements** (Next Quarter):
1. Consider implementing service health checks using the DI system
2. Explore service decorators for cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics)
3. Evaluate adding service interfaces/protocols for better abstraction

**Long-term Considerations**:
1. Monitor service performance and memory usage with new singleton patterns
2. Consider service registry pattern if service dependencies become more complex
3. Evaluate moving to more advanced DI container if requirements grow

## 9. Lessons Learned

**What Went Well**:
- Zero breaking changes achieved through careful planning
- ServiceContainer pattern worked well for mixed route/background task architecture
- Test updates were straightforward with proper mocking patterns
- Linting and formatting automation caught issues early

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Initial analysis could have better identified the background task DI limitations
- More documentation of service dependency patterns would be helpful for onboarding

**Best Practices Established**:
- All service instantiation must go through ServiceContainer
- Services requiring configuration should use factory methods
- Service tests should mock container methods, not service classes directly
- Use type annotations and dependency aliases for better IDE support
