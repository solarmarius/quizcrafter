1. Implemented Changes by Category

1.1 Architecture & Structure

Changes Implemented:

- [x] Centralized database engine and session management in app/core/db.py.
- [x] Introduced get_session() and get_async_session() context managers for consistent session handling.
- [x] Implemented a feature flag (USE_OPTIMIZED_DB_POOL) for controlled activation of new pool settings.

Details:

    1 # Before: app/core/db.py (simplified)
    2 # engine = create_engine(str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI))
    3
    4 # After: app/core/db.py (simplified)
    5 # engine = create_engine(str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI), **engine_args)
    6 # @contextmanager
    7 # def get_session() -> Generator[Session, None, None]:
    8 #     session = Session(engine)
    9 #     try:

10 # yield session
11 # session.commit()
12 # except Exception:
13 # session.rollback()
14 # raise
15 # finally:
16 # session.close()

Impact:

- Significantly improves maintainability and reduces boilerplate code related to database session management.
- Ensures proper session lifecycle (commit, rollback, close) across the application, preventing resource leaks.
- Provides a single source of truth for database configuration, making future changes easier.

1.2 Database Optimizations

Changes Implemented:

- [x] Configured SQLAlchemy's QueuePool with explicit settings (pool_size, max_overflow, pool_timeout, pool_recycle, pool_pre_ping).
- [x] Implemented NullPool for the test environment to avoid connection issues during automated testing.
- [x] Added SQLAlchemy event listeners for connection logging (connect, checkout, checkin) to enhance observability.
- [x] Created check_database_health() function to expose real-time connection pool metrics.

Details:

    1 # Before: app/core/db.py (simplified)
    2 # engine = create_engine(str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI))
    3
    4 # After: app/core/db.py (simplified)
    5 # engine_args = {
    6 #     "poolclass": get_pool_class(),
    7 #     "echo": settings.ENVIRONMENT == "local",
    8 # }
    9 # if settings.ENVIRONMENT != "test" and settings.USE_OPTIMIZED_DB_POOL:

10 # engine_args.update({
11 # "pool_size": settings.DATABASE_POOL_SIZE,
12 # "max_overflow": settings.DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW,
13 # "pool_timeout": settings.DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT,
14 # "pool_recycle": settings.DATABASE_POOL_RECYCLE,
15 # "pool_pre_ping": True,
16 # })
17 # engine: Engine = create_engine(str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI), \*\*engine_args)

Impact:

- Addresses connection exhaustion and performance bottlenecks under load.
- Improves application stability by handling stale and dead connections.
- Provides critical insights into database connection behavior for monitoring and debugging.

1.3 API Routes Refactoring

Changes Implemented:

- [x] Updated app/api/deps.py to use the new get_session() context manager for SessionDep.
- [x] Added a new /api/v1/utils/health/db endpoint to expose database connection pool health metrics.

Details:

1 # Before: app/api/deps.py (simplified)
2 # with Session(engine) as session:
3 # yield session
4
5 # After: app/api/deps.py (simplified)
6 # from app.core.db import get_session
7 # with get_session() as session:
8 # yield session

Impact:

- Ensures all API endpoints benefit from the centralized and optimized session management.
- Provides a dedicated endpoint for monitoring database health, crucial for production environments.

1.4 CRUD Operations Improvements

Changes Implemented:

- [x] Introduced new asynchronous CRUD functions in app/crud.py for operations requiring AsyncSession and SELECT FOR UPDATE locks:
  - get_quiz_for_update
  - update_quiz_content_extraction_status
  - update_quiz_llm_generation_status
  - get_approved_questions_by_quiz_id_async
  - get_content_from_quiz_async

Details:

1 # Example: app/crud.py (new function)
2 # async def get_quiz_for_update(session: AsyncSession, quiz_id: UUID) -> Quiz | None:
3 # result = await session.execute(
4 # select(Quiz).where(Quiz.id == quiz_id).with_for_update()
5 # )
6 # return result.scalar_one_or_none()

Impact:

- Enables safe and efficient asynchronous database operations within background tasks and services.
- Improves modularity and separation of concerns by encapsulating database logic within the CRUD layer.

1.5 Service Layer Enhancements

Changes Implemented:

- [x] Refactored app/services/canvas_quiz_export.py to use get_async_session() and the new asynchronous CRUD functions for database interactions.
- [x] Refactored app/services/mcq_generation.py (LangGraph service) to use get_async_session() and asynchronous CRUD functions for content preparation and saving questions.

Details:

1 # Before: app/services/canvas_quiz_export.py (simplified)
2 # with Session(engine) as session:
3 # quiz = get_quiz_by_id(session, quiz_id)
4
5 # After: app/services/canvas_quiz_export.py (simplified)
6 # async with get_async_session() as session:
7 # quiz = await get_quiz_for_update(session, quiz_id)

Impact:

- Ensures that long-running background tasks and external API interactions (e.g., Canvas API, LLM calls) do not block the event loop due to synchronous database calls.
- Improves the overall responsiveness and scalability of the application.

1.6 LangGraph Integration Optimization

Changes Implemented:

- [x] The MCQGenerationService in app/services/mcq_generation.py now leverages get_async_session() and asynchronous CRUD operations for its content_preparation and
      save_questions_to_database nodes.

Impact:

- Optimizes the LangGraph workflow by ensuring all database operations within the graph are non-blocking, improving the efficiency of question generation.

2. Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

Breaking Changes:

1.  Internal Session Management:
    - What changed: Direct usage of sqlmodel.Session(engine) or sqlmodel.Session(bind=connection) for session creation is replaced by with get_session() as session: (for synchronous code)
      or async with get_async_session() as session: (for asynchronous code).
    - Why it changed: To centralize connection pool configuration, ensure proper session lifecycle management (commit/rollback/close), and enable asynchronous database operations.
    - Migration steps:
      - Old way (synchronous):

1 from sqlmodel import Session
2 from app.core.db import engine
3
4 with Session(engine) as session:
5 # ... database operations ...

           * New way (synchronous):

1 from app.core.db import get_session
2
3 with get_session() as session:
4 # ... database operations ...

           * Old way (asynchronous):

1 from sqlmodel import Session
2 from app.core.db import engine
3
4 # This was problematic as Session(engine) is synchronous
5 with Session(engine) as session:
6 # ... async database operations (not truly async) ...

           * New way (asynchronous):

1 from app.core.db import get_async_session
2
3 async with get_async_session() as session:
4 # ... async database operations ...

Deprecations:

- No explicit features or methods were deprecated as part of this refactoring. The old session management pattern is implicitly deprecated by the new approach.

3. Technical Debt Analysis

Debt Reduced:

- Eliminated connection exhaustion issues under load.
- Resolved potential resource leaks due to improper session closing.
- Removed "magic numbers" by externalizing connection pool settings to configuration.
- Addressed lack of monitoring by introducing connection logging and a health check endpoint.
- Improved code clarity and maintainability by centralizing database logic.

Remaining Debt:

- No new technical debt was introduced. The refactoring focused on reducing existing critical debt.

4. Testing & Validation

Test Results:

- Unit Tests: New tests added for app/core/db.py (connection pool configuration, concurrent connections, session rollback, async session).
- Integration Tests: New performance tests added for app/tests/performance/test_db_pool.py. Existing integration tests for API routes and services were verified to pass after refactoring.

Validation Checklist:

- [x] All existing functionality preserved
- [x] API contracts maintained (or migration guide provided)
- [x] Database migrations tested and reversible (Alembic env.py updated)
- [x] LangGraph workflows functioning correctly
- [x] New database connection pool settings are applied
- [x] Asynchronous database operations are correctly implemented
