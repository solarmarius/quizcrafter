            1. Introduction
          </Heading>
          <Text mb={4}>
            The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational
            contexts has enabled automated generation of assessments in multiple
            languages. However, ensuring the quality of such content,
            particularly in low-resource languages like Norwegian remains a
            challenge. While much research focus on English language outputs,
            there is limited empirical validation of Norwegian AI-generated
            educational content.
          </Text>
          <Text mb={4}>
            The QuizCrafter application, developed to generate quiz questions
            from Canvas course content, provides an unique opportunity to study
            this research gap. With teachers actively validating, editing, and
            rejecting AI-generated questions, the system provides rich human
            expert feedback that can be used to assess and improve automatic
            quality evaluation methods.

            <strong>Data Collection:</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text mb={4}>
            The primary source of data will be collected from QuizCrafter
            application, which is deployed at Institute of Informatics. We
            expect to collect least 200 AI-generated questions, primarily in
            Norwegian, but also in English. Each question is stored along with
            the corresponding teacher action (approve/edit/delete), as well as a
            complete edit history. Data will be collected over a period of three
            months, with analysis conducted concurrently.

            The project will implement and evaluate multiple metrics across four

                questions and source content, internal consistency between
                questions and answer options, factual consistency

              <List.Item>
                <strong>Structural quality:</strong> question completeness,
                grammatical validity, answer option balance
              </List.Item>
              <List.Item>
                <strong>Pedagogical alignment:</strong> cognitive complexity

              <List.Item>

          <Text mb={4}>
            The research will also go into predictive modeling; training a model
            like logistic regression or decision trees to predict teacher action
            based on metric values. Feature importance and explainability will
            be examined using for example SHAP values. Also, a comparative
            analysis will be performed between language-specific models (e.g
            NorBERT) and more general LLMs (e.g. OpenAI) to evaluate the
            robustness of the metrics.

          </Heading>
          <Text mb={4}>
            This study presents an unique opportunity to validate quality
            metrics for Norwegian AI-generated educational questions using real
            teacher feedback. The project will empirically assess the
            effectiveness of different metrics, informing the design of
            real-time validation mechanisms for AI-generated content. The
            findings will provide actionable insights in both Norwegian and
            English educational contexts and contribute to the goals supporting
            responsible use of AI in Norwegian education.
