Critical Implementation Details

Circular Import Solutions

1. TokenEncryption moved to encryption.py
2. SessionDep moved to deps.py
3. TYPE_CHECKING imports for model relationships:
   ```python
   from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
   if TYPE_CHECKING:
       from app.models import Quiz  # in User model
   ```

Service Pattern

Moving from function-based CRUD to service classes:

```python
# Old: crud.create_user(session, user_create)
# New: AuthService(session).create_user(user_create)
```

Import Path Changes

- `from app.models import User` → `from app.auth.models import User`
- `from app.models import UserCreate` → `from app.auth.schemas import UserCreate`
- `from app.core.config import settings` → `from app.config import settings`
- `from app.api.routes.auth import router` → `from app.auth import router`

Next Steps (Phase 3: Canvas Module)

1. Create canvas module structure:

   - canvas/schemas.py - Canvas-specific schemas
   - canvas/service.py - Move content_extraction.py and canvas_quiz_export.py
   - canvas/router.py - Move canvas routes
   - canvas/dependencies.py - Canvas service factories
   - canvas/exceptions.py - Canvas-specific exceptions
   - canvas/utils.py - Canvas utilities

2. Update imports throughout codebase
3. Fix any test failures
4. Run linting
5. Commit changes

## Critical Application Startup Fixes Applied

### Circular Import Resolution

**Problem**: Circular dependency between app.database and app.auth.dependencies
**Root Cause**: database.py imported User, UserCreate, AuthService at module level while auth/dependencies.py imported get_session
**Solution Applied**:

- Moved auth imports in database.py to local imports within init_db function
- Updated auth/dependencies.py to use get_db from app.deps instead of get_session
- Added model imports to main.py and initial_data.py for SQLAlchemy relationship resolution

### Session Dependency Issues

**Problem**: AuthService receiving \_GeneratorContextManager instead of Session object
**Root Cause**: Using get_session (context manager) instead of get_db (FastAPI dependency)
**Solution Applied**:

- Updated all auth dependencies to use get_db instead of get_session
- get_session is for manual context management with `with get_session() as session:`
- get_db is for FastAPI dependency injection with `Depends(get_db)`

### Model Relationship Resolution

**Problem**: SQLAlchemy couldn't find 'Quiz' class when resolving User.quizzes relationship
**Solution Applied**: Added model imports to main.py and initial_data.py:

```python
import app.auth.models  # noqa
import app.quiz.models  # noqa
import app.question.models  # noqa
```

## Current Issues Being Resolved

### Async Session Type Conflicts

**Problem**: Services expect Session but async contexts provide AsyncSession
**Current Solution**: Made async methods static to avoid service instantiation with wrong session type:

- QuizService.get_quiz_for_update() -> @staticmethod
- QuizService.get_content_from_quiz() -> @staticmethod
- QuestionService.get_approved_questions_by_quiz_id_async() -> @staticmethod

**Files Updated**:

- app/quiz/service.py - made async methods static
- app/question/service.py - made async method static
- app/question/mcq_generation_service.py - updated to use static method calls
- app/canvas/quiz_export_service.py - updated to use static method calls

### MyPy Type Errors (Remaining)

**Current Errors**:

```
app/main.py:34: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "FastAPI", variable has type Module)
app/main.py:47: error: Module has no attribute "add_middleware"
app/main.py:52: error: Module has no attribute "add_middleware"
app/main.py:63: error: Module has no attribute "exception_handler"
app/main.py:75: error: Module has no attribute "include_router"
```

**Analysis**: MyPy thinks `app` variable is a module instead of FastAPI instance. This appears to be a naming conflict or cache issue, as the application runs correctly and `type(app)` shows `<class 'fastapi.applications.FastAPI'>`.

## Testing Status

### Working Tests

- Question CRUD tests: 15/15 passed
- Question API route tests: 13/13 passed
- Health check endpoint: 200 True
- Application imports successfully
- Basic FastAPI functionality confirmed working

### Test Files Needing Updates

Several test files still need service pattern updates:

- app/tests/crud/test_quiz.py - many missing quiz_service declarations
- app/tests/crud/test_question.py - some missing question_service declarations
- app/tests/api/routes/test_quiz_content_extraction.py - updated to use QuizService

## File Structure Changes

### Final Module Structure

│   ├── models.py (User model)
│   ├── schemas.py (auth schemas)
│   ├── service.py (AuthService)
│   ├── router.py, dependencies.py, utils.py, etc.

├── api/routes/ (only users.py, utils.py remain)
├── common.py (shared Message schema)
├── config.py, database.py, deps.py, etc. (root level)
```

### Deleted Files/Directories

- app/crud.py (moved to services)
- app/models.py (split into modules)
- app/services/ (moved to modules)
- app/core/ (moved to root level)

## Critical Implementation Details

### Service Pattern Implementation

- All CRUD operations moved from functions to service classes
- Services initialized with session: `service = SomeService(session)`
- Async operations use static methods to avoid session type conflicts

### Import Patterns

- Local imports used to break circular dependencies
- All models imported in main.py for SQLAlchemy relationship resolution
- TYPE_CHECKING imports for forward references

### Preserved Functionality

- LangGraph MCQ generation workflow exactly preserved
- Canvas OAuth flow unchanged
- All API endpoints maintain compatibility
- Database relationships maintained with string references

## Next Steps (Phase 7 Continuation)

1. **Resolve MyPy Errors**:

   - Investigate app variable naming conflict in main.py
   - Consider renaming or isolating the variable assignment

2. **Complete Test Updates**:

   - Add missing service declarations in test files
   - Update remaining crud references to service calls

3. **Run Full Linting**:

   - Fix any remaining ruff formatting issues
   - Ensure all type hints are correct

4. **Final Validation**:
   - Run complete test suite
   - Verify application starts correctly
   - Test key endpoints
   - Final commit

3. Circular Import: api.deps ↔ auth

   - Solution: Move SessionDep to deps.py

4. Python 3.12 Union Type Syntax

User Preferences Noted

1. Wants linting run before commits
2. Prefers step-by-step execution with validation
3. Wants tests passing at each phase
4. Expects clear commit messages per phase
5. Values maintaining API compatibility
6. Reminds to activate virtual environment

Critical Notes

- LangGraph Integration: Must preserve MCQ generation workflow exactly
- Canvas OAuth: Flow must remain unchanged
- Pre-commit Hooks: Auto-fix some issues on commit
- Docker Environment: Some tests fail outside Docker (canvas-mock connectivity)
- Python Version: 3.12 requires Optional[] instead of "| None" syntax

This refactoring is transforming a working but monolithic codebase into a clean, modular
architecture while maintaining all functionality. The key challenge is managing the
interdependencies during the transition.
